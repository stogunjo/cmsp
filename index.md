Thin films are microscopically thin layers of material—ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometers in thickness—that are deposited onto surfaces to enhance their properties or add new functionalities. These nearly invisible coatings can be made from various materials, including metals, semiconductors, insulators, and organic compounds. In electronics, thin films essential components of semiconductor devices, integrated circuits, and display screens. They are also used for anti-reflective coatings on glasses and camera lenses, while the energy sector employs them in solar cells and energy-efficient windows. In healthcare, thin films serve as biocompatible coatings for medical implants and antimicrobial surfaces.  The importance of thin films lies in their ability to fundamentally change surface properties while using minimal material, making them an indispensable technology in our continuing technological advancement.

Chaos is ubiquitous. Exploring the hidden patterns in chaos, our cutting-edge research investigates complex dynamical systems that shape our world. At the intersection of mathematics and real-world applications, we specialize in nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, and advanced time series analysis. Our research focuses on two key areas: first, the synchronization and control of dynamical systems (ODE, FDE, PDE), revolutionizing secure communications through chaos-based encryption. Second, we decode the complexity hidden in natural time series data, from the mysteries of geospace and atmospheric patterns to the rhythms of financial markets and biological systems. By developing innovative mathematical frameworks and computational methods, we're uncovering the fundamental laws governing chaotic systems. Our research impacts diverse fields including climate science, cryptography, financial forecasting, and biomedical signal analysis.
