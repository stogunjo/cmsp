Thin films are microscopically thin layers of material—ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometers in thickness—that are deposited onto surfaces to enhance their properties or add new functionalities. These nearly invisible coatings can be made from various materials, including metals, semiconductors, insulators, and organic compounds. In electronics, thin films essential components of semiconductor devices, integrated circuits, and display screens. They are also used for anti-reflective coatings on glasses and camera lenses, while the energy sector employs them in solar cells and energy-efficient windows. In healthcare, thin films serve as biocompatible coatings for medical implants and antimicrobial surfaces.  The importance of thin films lies in their ability to fundamentally change surface properties while using minimal material, making them an indispensable technology in our continuing technological advancement.

Chaos is ubiquitous. Our research in nonlinear dynamics and chaos includes (i) theoretical and experimental synchronization and control of ODE, FDE, PDE dynamical systems with applications to secure communications, (ii) time series analysis of dynamical complexity in natural time series such as geospace, atmospheric sciences, economics, and biophysical signals.
